# Harmony Trainer

This is a work in progress and, as of this writing, doesn't do much.

But it uses JUCE6! Cool eh?

Anyway if you want to build it, fork or clone this repo then:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -Bbuild
cmake --build build --config Release
```

and you should get an executable.
